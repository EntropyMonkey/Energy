C2 - Energy

A mini strategy game created with Unity3D. Several Powerplants on a map produce Power and Pollution. Houses create Workforce and need Power, but they don't like polluted neighborhoods. The difficult part of the game is to balance Pollution, Output and Workforce.

The game idea was created at a holiday camp called Computer Camp. Twelve young people worked on the project for one week and created the basics of the game while learning to use Unity.
